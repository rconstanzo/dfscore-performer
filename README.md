dfs Performer by Rodrigo Constanzo
==================================

The dfscore system enables groups of any size to collectively improvise without a conductor while still retaining moments of synchronicity. Each performerâ€™s laptop, connected to a central router, displays information that is only relevant to them: melodic or rhythmic fragments, accompanying tempo and count in, role to assume.
